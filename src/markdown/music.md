If you've read about my profile so far and you found it interesting, studies show that knowing what type of music a person listens to would say a lot about them.

Also, I've been known for my good taste in music and I've always wanted to share the latest and greatest hits through an easy medium, so here's a Spotify Playlist I've created called **ultimate mix**. This isn't a cohesive or practical playlist by any chance, but more or less to put my 5 favourite genres (New Age Piano, C-Pop, K-Pop, J-Pop, 2010s Pop) into one convienient place.
