Hey there!

I'm Zhihua Han (韩志华), and this is my website. Currently, I am an MSc Physics student researching quantum computing at Simon Fraser University, in Kero Lau's research group. This website showcases the many personal projects that I've built but don't quite fit into a traditional CV / resume.
