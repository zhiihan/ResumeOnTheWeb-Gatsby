Hey there!

I'm Zhi Hua Han (韩志华), and this is my website. Currently, I am an MSc Physics student researching quantum computing at Simon Fraser University, in Kero Lau's research group. This website showcases my many interests including physics/math, piano, photography, game development, language learning, and travelling.

My life philosophy is that you should become as powerful as possible by levelling up like in video games. Often you'll meet enemies along the way, but defeating a boss unlocks new rewards, abilities and skills. I believe this concept extends to real life.

In other words, _when you overcome resistance, you absorb its power. The greater the resistance, the greater the power._ Like in games, we should run towards the path with the most difficulty, not the least. This process of snowballing and becoming unstoppable can be both fun and rewarding, which is why I study physics. Knowledge = Power, and so I have a love of learning things.

$$
{\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L} &=-\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} +i \bar{\psi} \cancel{D} \psi+h.c. \\
&+\psi_{i} y_{i j} \psi_{j} \phi+h.c. \\
&+\left|D_{\mu} \phi\right|^{2}-V(\phi)
\end{aligned}}
$$

Quantum computing is the study of using quantum mechanics to speed up complex computational problems. I believe it can revolutionize scientific research. *Just how many problems can you solve, how many technologies can you enable if only you had a faster computer*? This is why quantum computing is OP. 

I created this website so I could showcase all the challenges and resistance I've overcome, but also many of my achievements through the process. If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love to hear from you!
