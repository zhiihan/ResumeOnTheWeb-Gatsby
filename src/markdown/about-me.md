Hey there!

I'm Zhi Hua Han (韩志华), and this is my website. Currently, I am an MSc Physics student researching quantum computing at Simon Fraser University, in Kero Lau's research group. This website showcases my many interests including physics/math, piano, photography, East Asian culture, language learning, and travelling.

The central theme around my life is _information_. It turns out the concept of information is very multifaceted and mysterious. In physics, it is closely related to _entropy_ and _entanglement_. Quantum information, unlike classical information, is a conserved quantity through the _no-cloning_ and _no-deleting_ theorems.

In other areas, information shows up as the _efficient market hypothesis_, the datasets used in machine learning, specialization of labour, digital footprint, or a winning strategy for which knowing information can help us make better decisions. Knowledge helps you unlock more opportunities so you can explore the world with unbounded curiousity. Fact: information helps you win at life. 读万卷书，行万里路.

This is why in undergrad, I made it my objective to take as many courses as possible, but also partly because I have a love of learning. So like the main character of a story, I want to learn as many things as possible so I become as powerful as possible. I don't believe that geniuses or gifted students exist. I think it comes down to hard work, luck, and environment.

So how do we become as powerful as possible? By reshaping our environment so that it positively reinforces our habits and behaviour. Experiment through trial and error. [To learn is to generalize.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efR8ybG7Ihs) There is [no speed limit.](https://sive.rs/kimo) We should seek out resistance in our lives and overcome it, because _[when you overcome resistance, you gain its power. The greater the resistance, the greater the power.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rim2rXIbVoA)_ Physics is hard. Which is why I study it.

I created this website so I could showcase all the challenges and resistance I've overcome, but also many of my achievements through the process. If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love to hear from you!
